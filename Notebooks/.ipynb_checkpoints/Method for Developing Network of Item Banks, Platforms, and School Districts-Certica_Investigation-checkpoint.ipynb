To constrain the scope of this part of the study, we are focusing attention on existing school district assessment management system vendors among the 50 largest public school districts in the United States."

    "1. Google hates when you try and automatically search things, and it will stop working if it feels that a bot is doing the Googling (we could try and get around this by varying and lengthing the times between each request -- not an entirely professional approach). In the example above, it returned 36 of 1000 requests before erroring out. \n",
    "2. Alternatively, we can be copcetic and use Bing. For more than 1000 requests in a month, we have to pay something like $30 dollars. I have done a little proof of concept to see how well it would perform, and the returned URLs are often not the same as with Google (in some cases, not as good; in other cases, just different), but we could probably work to try and improve upon what is being returend by fine-tuning the search terms to better fit how Bing searches (e.g., make sure we are using the correct logic operators, etc). \n",
    "3. This still leaves the manual task of reviewing the urls to see which links are worthy documentation that a school district is using a particular platform (backed by a particular item bank). But, I think that the visual inspection does go pretty quickly -- clearly Pinterest, for example, won't be a link we are interested in pursuing. We could, however, find additional automatic ways to parse the data, so that we are only left with serious candidates to exam.\n"
